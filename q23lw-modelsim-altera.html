Intel® FPGA simulation with ModelSim -Intel® FPGA software supports behavioral and gate-level simulations, including VHDL or Verilog test benches. ARCH Linux (kernel 4.6.2.1) Modelsim 10.4d, solved the freetype2 problem, compiled and symlinked the 32-bit libraries (freetype2-2.5.0.1-1-i686). Also patched the specific files for the "linux_rh60" problem. Modelsim starts with no warnings but the source window font is not readable (very small). Tried changing the font Tools gt Edit Preferences gt Source Windows gt fixedFont (ModelSim seems not to react to this), editing pref.tcl file and setting fixedFont from there, all to no avail. ModelSim - Altera Edition  ModelSim - Altera Edidtion (AE) такая же мощная и удобная среда моделирования как и оринигнальная ModelSim, с тем лишь отличием, что ориентирована она исключительно. 
I've been installing en reinstalling ModelSim, versions 16.1 and 17.1. I keep having trouble with freetype. Guides say that I need an older version of freetype. They basically boil down to: Download an old version of 32-bit freetype (for example 2.5.0.1) Make a new folder named lib32 in the ModelSim installation folder and put the freetype libraries in it. Edit the file named vco (sometimes bin/vsim, which is a symlink to the same file), and in this file: Change the line `mode=${MTI.

I use /r/ece to vent my internal frustrations with shit posting. "Hi, do any of the following apply to you?" "Golly gee, I always wanted to learn about digital hardware but don't know where to start?" Not quite sure what this very Logs stuff is? VeehechDel? What is this stuff? Some new dance move the kids are talking about? Do you think EDA is some new street drug those crazy kids are doing near your house? Still using 74xx chips. Инструкция по работе с инструментом ModelSim Altera 1 Указание пути к инструменту симуляции ModelSim. I know vhdl-2008 isn't supported for synthesis in most tools. For simulation, I noticed ghdl: 1. supports generic types in generic packages. 2. does not support generic types in entity declarations vivado (xsim): 1. claims to support generic types in entity declarations 2. does not support generic packages. Anyone know for Modelsim, Aldec Главная > ModelSim по-русски  пришедшем на смену встроенному симулятору от Altera - ModelSim SE от Mentor Graphics. Hey guys, have a simple question. I have been generating a few ip cores from quartus 17.0 and instead of the old vho files, I have to compile all of these libraries to get the IP core to run. I was just wondering if there was a command in modelsim that can decipher the msim.tcl that comes with all the cores so that I can use that command in a batch script. ModelSim Altera Edition - самая быстрая версия симулятора, без ограничений на размер проекта. Стоимость 5 на сегодня (13 декабря 2010 года). I'm researching how to test my verilog modules, using altera-modelsim. I'm all set up, using this guide: However when in Quartus I do: tools -gt run simulate tool -gt gate level simulate. Modelsim opens and gives the following error: # Loading work.delayTest # Error: (vsim-3033) C:/Users/username/Documents/FPGA/testtest/testbench.v(13): Instantiation of 'Delay' failed. The design unit was not found. 
ModelSim is a multi-language HDL simulation environment by Mentor Graphics, for simulation of hardware description languages such as VHDL, Verilog and SystemC, and includes a built-in C debugger. Hi guys, I want to ask a question. I'm trying to simulate a cpu. I did my schema and basically there are two logical parts of the CPU. The first part is composed of a FIFO buffer, Cache memory for instructions and a PC register. I created architecture and entities for each of the 3 named elements. Can I make one entity that contains all of these 3 entities and their architectures? I'm stubmbled on how to do that, and I would appreciate any help you can provide ;) EDIT:. ModelSim Altera Tutorial . Start a new Quartus Project using the Project Wizard and choose sums as the name of design and top module; in Step 4/5 of the project creation, make sure to select "ModelSim Altera Edition"  The ModelSim-Altera Starter Edition is a program for use in the simulation of small field-programmable gate arrays. It is the free version of the ModelSim software from Altera and thus has restrictions on its use: it can only be used with a maximum of 10,000 executable line limitations I'm trying to work with the 16.0 version. Last year I got it to work but now that I'm using a fresh install can't seam to do the same thing. ModelSim PE Student Edition is a free download of the industry leading ModelSim HDL simulator for use by students in their academic coursework. I have a technical interview in a couple weeks which involves VHDL. Its entry level but I want to be very familiar with VHDL. I have some experience with it but its been almost a year now and I would really like a refresher. Is there any software I can get at home to at least get the basics down? What book would you recommend. Tutorial on how to use ModelSim. By Kirk Weedman. see www.hdlexpress.com to download the files used in this presentation. 
I want to learn FPGAs on my own (verilog) and am deciding between the Digilent Nexys4 DDR (with the Xilinx Artix-7) or the Terasic DE1-SoC (with the Altera Cyclone V). Both have a ton of stuff (but i think the DE1-SoC might win over the Nexys4 due to its extra stuff like DAC and multiple audio jacks, etc). But the differences are pretty minimal it seems. What is really getting me is what IDE i will have to live with. I have heard really good things about Qaurtus and Vivado both. So my questi. Описание методики симуляции проекта SDRAM контроллера с помощью ModelSim ALtera. EDIT: Solved (see bottom EDIT) I'm working a module, one parameter is a single bit input. I want to use an enum here for clarity, so I can have ACTION_NONE and ACTION_TOGGLE. To allow passing this in from other modules I have the enum defined in a package. package TimerPackage; typedef enum logic 1:0 { TIMER_ACTION_NONE, TIMER_ACTION_TOGGLE } TimerAction; endpackage At first I had this at the top of my Timer.sv This tutorial is for use with the Altera DE-nano boards. There are a number in the eshop. See Mary if you cannot find one. In this tutorial, we will program the DE-nano board, to be a simple 3 bit counter. I know OF Verilator and Icarus, and of course, Quartus. I was looking for something much smaller and similar to the various free Spice modelers. I'm not looking to compile huge, complex code; but simply something to help me learn HDL - Verilog in particular, while viewing the circuits ModelSim-Altera 6.6d (Quartus II Starter Edition, скачать бесплатно.

I've used Microsemi Libero, Xilinx Vivado, and Altera Quartus tools. In Libero, when I create a new VHDL file, I can automatically have a basic VHDL template written into the code. When I'm done, I can right-click on the file, click "Create TestBench", and have a testbench autogenerated, complete with clock, reset, simulation code, and my entity instantiated with the I/O brought out. I can right-click on that, press "Run Simulation", and bam have the whole thing running in ModelSim ModelSim-Altera 6.4a (Quartus II, скачать бесплатно. ModelSim-Altera 6.4a (Quartus II: Model Technology. I am contemplating talking to management at work to move from our paid toolchain of Aldec Active-HDL and ModelSim to something like GTKWave/GHDL. I am curious about this transition for HDL development as we spend a lot of money for licensing with these tools and I feel that 95% of us don't use them to their full potential anyways. For background, we have about 20 or so floating licenses along with 5 servers, I believe, that have node-locked licenses that we use for RTL verification between. ModelSim combines high performance & high capacity with the code coverage & debugging capabilities required to simulate larger blocks & systems. Hi, I'm used to working with Vivado/sdk on xilinx fpgas. I'm trying to get some inkling of what it is "on the other side" but i'm flabbergasted at how little you find on the internet. When you google for tutorials or get started guides for xilinx fpgas you find stuff to get you going immediately. Altera/intel wise I can't find anything for my specific DEVKIT. I've got the MAX10M50 devkit and it seems that the little help you get in the form of a very small number of demos, it's all written. A brief tutorial outlining how to structure a project folder for the DE10-LITE Board, how to set-up a ModelSim Project, and how to set-up a Quartus Project. Hey, I'm an engineering student interested in digital systems. I've used FPGAs for a bunch of classes that ranged from running C and assembly programs to designing the circuitry in verilog. The boards we use in class are terasic DE0 evaluation boards which I like because they have a lot of switches, LEDs, built in USB, and a four digit 7 segment display. I have an unfinished project from the semester of designing a mini risc computer that I plan to finish over the summer 平台 软件：ModelS im-Altera 6.5e (Quartus II 10.0) Starter Edition 内容 1 设计流程 使用 ModelSim 仿真的基本流程为： 图 1.1 使用 ModelSim 仿真的基本流程 2 开始 2.1 新建工程 打开 ModelSim 后，其画面如图 2.1 所示。.

Xilinx® ISE® software provides an integrated flow with the Model Technology ModelSim simulator, which allows you to run simulation from the Xilinx Project Navigator. Why is the lab component of this class so horrible? CS students are denied access to SF boards because there is 'too many of us' meaning no practice boards for us So I have to choose between eating for 2 weeks or buying an Altera board, which really sucks Modelsim is useless when due to time constraints seen later Lab instructions are horrible Weeks 1 2 and 3 are fine, week 4 is impossible.

My apologies if this is not the right place to ask. I took a class in spring semester on logic design and we used Verilog for some basic things and found that I really liked it. However, it's the only logic design class mandated for my major (EE) and I don't really have much class space to take anything else as an elective (going into my last year). I've done some FPGA stuff using Altera ModelSim but probably nothing that could compare to formal schooling in it. What sorts of things would.

I've been teaching myself verilog with bits of system verilog thrown in for the last few weeks. My background is embedded CS, so I know a fair bit about electronics, but have not done a huge amount with FPGAs before. I've created a project and commited it to git here: removed after 3 weeks to protect my identity It's designed for the DE2 eval board, it takes two 8 bit numbers (from switches), adds them (using a carry lookahead adder), then displays the result in LEDs, 7-segment displays. Creating Testbench using ModelSim-Altera Wave Editor You can use ModelSim-Altera Wave Editor to draw your test input waveforms and generate a Verilog. 
I'm graduating May 2017 with a BS/MS dual degree in CompE with a focus on wireless communications/networks. I'm aiming for a wireless communications full-time position with a focus on DSP implementation in FPGAs/ASICs with VHDL/Verilog (think Qualcomm). The potential problem with my resume is I had to get rid of the skills section in order to fit it in 1 page. I've done 4 separate co-ops which take up a lot of space. I also want to include 2 relevant academic projects, one being my Masters. 私は、アルテラのQuartus 15.0 WebエディションでUbuntu Linux 14.04 LTSを使用しています。ライセンスエラーのためにデザインをシミュレートするのに苦労しています。私はアルテラのCyclone IV EP4CE115でテラシックにVEEK-MTのLCD. Hi I am looking for a new laptop for school (software engineering) and I have been looking at the lenovo yoga 2 pro vs the asus zenbook ux303LA.

Introduction. Altera provide a integrated version of Modelsim for its FPGA. To simulate design with less than 10000 lines of code it's possible Hi I am currently self teaching myself Verilog and I had a very dumb question regarding how to program the actual FPGA itself. I am currently using ModelSim Student edition to simulate and I bought a cheap Altera Cyclone II and a USB Blaster. If you have any references for good practices or any information regarding Verilog it will be appreciated. hi everyone, I tried typing what said up there but did not work, however i figured it out. This is what i did: 1. at the very top of my Quartus II window there is an address that reads: C:/altera/14.1/ (the name of my file.). Introduction: Altera Quartus II software allows the user to launch Modelsim-Altera simulator from within the software using the Quartus II feature called NativeLink. Unfortunately, out of the box, the ModelSim-Altera simulation tool will not run from either the Quartus Prime Lite IDE nor the cmdline under a modern (post-4.x kernel), 64-bit, Linux.
