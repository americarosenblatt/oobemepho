So far my list is as follows: _____________________ Adventure Time Band of Brothers Battlestar Galactica Better Call Saul Blackadder Black Mirror Boardwalk Empire Bojack Horseman Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey Cowboy Bebop Curb Your Enthusiasm Daredevil Deadwood Dexter DragonBall. 
Привет, новичок. Мы полностью обновили наш тест, вопросы стали сложнее и почётного звания "Знаток Южного Парка" добиться стало гораздо сложнее. I've waited for it since it first appeared and now that i have it, i wish i haven't even took the time to make an account.

Ones to make me feel for the characters and enjoy watching. I've seen The Office, Dexter, Big Bang Theory, Breaking Bad, Sherlock, Futurama, Game of Thrones, Legend of Korra, and Avatar the last Airbender and I loved them all so much.

HBO объявил дату выхода финального сезона Game of Thrones. Восьмой (и последний) сезон одного из главных хитов HBO стартует на канале 14-го апреля. I watch a lot of tv, and I want to watch more. From what I've read, you guys have generally the best taste in television around here, what are your other favourite shows? Update: Some great suggestions so far, as requested, here is a list of shows I already watch, most of them have been mentioned already, anything new would be amazing, I'm thinking real unknown gems, my personal suggestion would be Black Books, one of my favourite shows. 30 Rock, Adventure Time, American Dad, Archer, Arrested. Bros, I hate self appraisal type stuff, so writing an online dating profile is like my idea of hell. But I've done it now. I'd really appreciate your feedback. There's a selection of photos at and (constructive) comments would be appreciated. My self-summary Hi, I'm Ollie. I tend towards the analytical end of the spectrum of humanity but, as awesome as they are, man cannot live by numbers alone. I try to balance my nerd out by reading stuff other than sci-fi Prices include shipping within the US (happy to combine shipping on multiple Pops). Price negotiable on 3+ Pops. Condition varies, none are mint but many are near-mint or with minor flaws/imperfections. Can provide individual/closeup photos, just ask. Includes PopShield soft protector when noted! Verification (https://imgur.com/OrHD58M). Wall-E  Carl  Stitch (Elvis)  (w/PopShield) Dumbo  The Big Friendly Giant  Maleficent  Shere Khan  (w/PopShield) Snow White. 
I recently moved here from CA and the only person I know in the area is my husband. I used to hang with my friends all the time, so I'm pretty starved for human contact. TL;DR of me: Medium height woman, slightly chubby and working on it. Short brown hair. I like to game (3DS and PC usually-Zelda, Terraria, etc.). I smoke a bowl every now and then. I read a lot (Game of Thrones, Ender's Game, currently reading Snow Crash, etc.). Netflix binge (Doctor Who, The Office, Futurama, Game of Thrones. Likes sci-fi, video games (probably has all he the games and systems he wants), Blade Runner, Star Wars, Batman, Futurama, Game of Thrones Adventure Time, geekery, and food. Mostly an indoor person, so not into camping equipment and the like. We celebrate Steak and Knobber day, so something different would Yeah, I know the posting tips in the sidebar say not to be deprecatory or whatever, but dammit its hard. I kinda suck. And yes I know being negative scares people off and I'm certainly not trying to give off an emo impression but its just, uggghh. Fine, okay. Positive, happy thoughts. :D I'm just your average, everyday introverted kinda guy. Reading, video games, music, movies and TV. The usual stuff. Stephen King, Palahniuk, G.R.R. Martin, J.K. Rowling. Retro stuff 
Thanks everyone for your suggestions, a lot of these look really good. Hey guys, I've been looking for a new TV show to get hooked on. Are there any shows that you watch religiously? Edit: Here is a list of shows I have recently watched; 30 Rock Adventure Time American Dad Archer Arrested Development, Big Bang Theory Black Adder Boston Legal Breaking Bad Burn Notice Chuck Community Curb Your Enthusiasm Dexter Doctor Who Drew Carey Show Family Guy Firefly Futurama Prices include shipping within the US (happy to combine shipping on multiple Pops, & discount on lots). Can provide individual/closeup photos, just ask. Includes PopShield soft protector when noted! Verification (https://imgur.com/XzG7nac). Wall-E  Carl  Stitch (Elvis)  (w/PopShield) Dumbo  The Big Friendly Giant  ~~Peasant Belle~~ Maleficent  Shere Khan  (w/PopShield) ~~Cogsworth~~ ~~Mrs. Potts & Chip~~ Snow White & Evil Queen  Sulley. Okay guys, I watch a lot of TV. I'm looking for some recommendations for something new to catch up with over the summer. Here is a full list of everything I've watched, with my favourites in bold. I am open to miniseries, documentaries, movies, whatever. 30 Rock, Alice, An Idiot Abroad, Arrested Development , Avatar, Battlestar Galactica , Being Human, Better Off Ted, The Big Bang Theory, The Big C, Big Love , Bones, Breaking Bad , Caprica, Chuck, Clone High, Community , Cowboy. Hey y'all! After living on the east coast for most of my life, I'm making the move out to CO at the end of the month for work in Boulder. I can't really afford to live in the city itself, so I'm looking for a place to stay around Broomfield, Denver, Aurora, Westminster, basically anywhere within driving distance. I'm a 29 yr old cake decorator who loves board/card/video games, Star Wars, Futurama, Game of Thrones, karaoke, rock climbing, and pub trivia. I'm low-maintenance, laid-back Heys! I am a socialy awkward guy that looks for someone to talk with,since i pretty much have no friends irl,so i am probably desperate for some company. I like some TV shows such as Futurama,Game of Thrones,The Walking Dead,South Park and some animes like Gintama,Future Diary,Death Note and etc. Although i don't play much games i love lores of game series like Fallout for example. I love electronic music and I am going to study computers in university soon. I am using pretty much only Skype. 
So a friend helped me setup SABnzb, Sonarr (NZBdrone), CouchPotato, Astraweb, and Plex. He also setup Usenet-Crawler. But Sonarr wouldn't see my seasons (American Horror Story Archer Doctor Who Futurama Game of Thrones Gotham Six Feet Under South Park Twin Peaks Workaholics), but did see all my Star Trek and Steins;Gate. So i just deleted all of the ones it didn't see and planned on redownloading them. Well that didn't work out, because I tried to download them but they were all like 1.5gb. Looking for some individual recommendations. Shows should be from 2000 or newer, most of the older stuff just annoys me. Like: Arrested Development Boston Legal Modern Family Parks & Recreation Jericho The Shield Firefly The Sopranos Daybreak Breaking Bad Dexter Shameless (US) Scrubs Raising Hope Surface Big Bang Theory Community Seasons 1 and 2 Happy Endings Corner Gas Chuck Hornblower (the BBC series) Boardwalk Empire Prison Break Veronica. I know what you were really hoping for is a wall of text, so here it is! So the title pretty much sums it up. I've posted here before but have recently come to the realization that I really have no idea what I'm looking for whether it's a friend, a girlfriend, a fwb situation, a online friend, a gaming buddy, a teammate or what have you. But I am looking for something. Onto the about me section, well there's a lot to tell (as I'm sure could be said for most people). I'm a guy, tall, dirty.

I'm a massive fan of Burn Notice, Futurama, Game of Thrones, and literally a whole bunch of other stuff. I want to contribute to ratings however my family can't afford Cable (or the channels that have all these Tv shows. infact some of these TV shows aren't even in the UK I don't think), Is there any way a brit like me can do my part in adding my +1 to a viewcount without. </p>
